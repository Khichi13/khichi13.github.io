An absolutely phenomenal piece of writing by Hosseini. He does a wonderful job in sewing together different narratives, seemingly disconnected at first glance, into a satisfying ending. Khaled Hosseini chose to take his readers on an emotional rollercoaster with this book, making them experience love, laughter, longing, heartache and sadness altogether. I would really recommend this novel. Five stars.
