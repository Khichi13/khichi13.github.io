This is one of the best sociological and ideological review of comparatively recent Pakistani history. Although a little behind the times, Pakistan: A Hard Country ensures the reader understands the fundamentals of what brought the country to this point as well as what the future holds for it. Anatol Lieven is an excellent writer, blending historical writing, cultural writing, journalism, and narrative into one rich and diverse tapestry of Pakistan.

This book provides insight about the majority of the population; their beliefs, their ideals and who they support. The underlying kinship and patronage system of every institution of the state is described in detail.

It is unfortunate that although a decade has passed, most conclusions reached by the author and his advice, despite making much sense to even a common Pakistani like me, has not been taken that seriously by the West or even indeed most of our own officials.

I am hopeful that the current leadership of the state will bring about much good for the country and act on the problems highlighted by Lieven.

I recommend this book to every Pakistani and the people who have vested interest in the country. This will give them a basic understanding of the system and procedures of the country as well as how to navigate them. It will at the least give them basic understanding about the history and culture of Pakistan.
